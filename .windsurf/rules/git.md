# Working with Git Version Control

- Use 'Conventional Commits' standards when writing commit messages for git
- Prefix all branches with 'feature/' to ensure they're organised correctly in git.
- If working on a change related to a backlog task, include the task id in the branch name, i.e. `feature/task-2-implement-prettier`
- Make task-related feature branch names shorter, around four words after the task id. Don't just include the whole task title if it's long
- Commit messages should be brief and to the point. Summarise the change as concisely as possible
