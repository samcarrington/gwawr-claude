description: Pick either a user-chosen or LLM-selected task and begin work on it
---

If the user specifies a task id, use the backlog CLI to access the task, assign it to yourself, and branch and begin work.

If a user wants you to pick your own task, assess the backlog of to-do tasks and identify three high priority candidates. Offer a choice back to the user of which task to begin.
