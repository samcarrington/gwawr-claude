## Description

Use prettier for code linting and formatting, with two space indent for files, semicolons for line endings in TS/JS and single quotes as string delimiters in JS/TS

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Prettier is installed as dev dependency
- [x] Prettier configuration file is created with specified rules
- [x] All JS/TS files use 2 space indentation
- [x] All JS/TS files use semicolons for line endings
- [x] All JS/TS files use single quotes as string delimiters
- [x] Format script is added to package.json
- [x] Existing code is formatted according to new rules

## Implementation Plan

1. Install Prettier as dev dependency
2. Create .prettierrc configuration file with specified rules
3. Create .prettierignore file for files to exclude
4. Add format and format:check scripts to package.json
5. Format all existing code files with new rules
6. Test that formatting works correctly

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented Prettier for code formatting with all specified requirements:

Files created/modified:
- .prettierrc - Configuration with 2 space indent, semicolons, single quotes
- .prettierignore - Excludes build outputs, dependencies, and backlog files
- package.json - Added format and format:check scripts

Key accomplishments:
- Prettier installed as dev dependency (v3.6.2)
- All existing files formatted with new rules
- Verified format check passes successfully
- Configuration follows project requirements exactly

Technical decisions:
- Used JSON format for .prettierrc for clarity
- Added comprehensive .prettierignore to exclude generated files
- Preserved backlog markdown formatting by ignoring backlog/ directory
- Added both format and format:check scripts for development workflow
