## Description

Use prettier for code linting and formatting, with two space indent for files, semicolons for line endings in TS/JS and single quotes as string delimiters in JS/TS

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Prettier is installed as dev dependency
- [x] Prettier configuration file is created with specified rules
- [x] All JS/TS files use 2 space indentation
- [x] All JS/TS files use semicolons for line endings
- [x] All JS/TS files use single quotes as string delimiters
- [x] Format script is added to package.json
- [x] Existing code is formatted according to new rules

## Implementation Plan

1. Install Prettier as dev dependency\n2. Create .prettierrc configuration file with specified rules\n3. Create .prettierignore file for files to exclude\n4. Add format and format:check scripts to package.json\n5. Format all existing code files with new rules\n6. Test that formatting works correctly

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented Prettier for code formatting with all specified requirements:\n\nFiles created/modified:\n- .prettierrc - Configuration with 2 space indent, semicolons, single quotes\n- .prettierignore - Excludes build outputs, dependencies, and backlog files\n- package.json - Added format and format:check scripts\n\nKey accomplishments:\n- Prettier installed as dev dependency (v3.6.2)\n- All existing files formatted with new rules\n- Verified format check passes successfully\n- Configuration follows project requirements exactly\n\nTechnical decisions:\n- Used JSON format for .prettierrc for clarity\n- Added comprehensive .prettierignore to exclude generated files\n- Preserved backlog markdown formatting by ignoring backlog/ directory\n- Added both format and format:check scripts for development workflow
