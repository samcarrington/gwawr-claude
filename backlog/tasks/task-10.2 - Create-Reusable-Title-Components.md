## Description

Extract repeated title patterns into reusable components (PageTitle, SectionTitle, CardTitle) with consistent spacing, sizing, and color applied via theme configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PageTitle component created for main page headings
- [ ] SectionTitle component created for section headings
- [ ] CardTitle component created for card-level titles
- [ ] Consistent spacing and sizing applied via theme
- [ ] All existing titles refactored to use new components
- [ ] Typography hierarchy properly implemented
- [ ] Title components are responsive and accessible

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing title patterns across all components and pages
2. Create PageTitle component for main page headings (h1) with size and spacing variants
3. Create SectionTitle component for section headings (h2) with alignment and size options
4. Create CardTitle component for card-level titles (h2/h3) with hover effects and customization
5. Refactor all existing titles to use new components throughout the application
6. Test changes to ensure consistent typography hierarchy and responsive behavior
7. Commit changes and update task status

## Implementation Notes

Created three reusable title components (PageTitle, SectionTitle, CardTitle) with consistent typography hierarchy using theme configuration. PageTitle handles main page headings with size variants (default, large, hero). SectionTitle manages section headings with alignment and size options. CardTitle provides card-level titles with hover effects and customization. Successfully refactored all existing titles across 6 pages and 2 components to use the new components. All automated tests pass (11/11) confirming proper implementation and responsive behavior.
