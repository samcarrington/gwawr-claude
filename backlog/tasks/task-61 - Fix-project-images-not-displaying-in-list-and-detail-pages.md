## Description

Project images (Thumbnail and Banner) exist in Contentful but are not appearing on the project list page or detail pages. The issue appears to be in the API data extraction or transformation layer, where image data from Contentful is not being properly processed and passed to the frontend components.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Investigate Contentful content model configuration for project images
- [x] Analyze current API implementation for image field handling
- [x] Review contentful transformers for image processing
- [x] Update Contentful SDK usage for proper image processing
- [x] Fix project list page image display
- [x] Fix project detail page image display
- [x] Test image rendering across different screen sizes

## Implementation Plan

1. Fix transformProject function to extract bannerImage and thumbnail fields instead of images field\n2. Update Project type interface to include separate thumbnail and bannerImage properties\n3. Update project list components to use thumbnail field\n4. Update project detail components to use bannerImage field\n5. Test image display on both list and detail pages\n6. Add proper error handling for missing images

## Implementation Notes

Successfully identified and fixed the root cause of missing project images. The transformProject function was looking for a non-existent 'images' field instead of the actual 'bannerImage' and 'thumbnail' fields from Contentful. Updated Project interface to include separate thumbnail and bannerImage fields, fixed transformProject function to extract these fields using getAssetUrl with proper optimization (WebP format, appropriate sizing), and updated frontend components to use the correct image fields. API now returns optimized image URLs and components display images correctly.
