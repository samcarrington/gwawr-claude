## Description

Build a projects page that displays a portfolio of work with project details, images, and links to live demos or repositories

Each project should have a title, description, category and image.

The most recent project should be displayed first, with the rest listed in reverse chronological order.

The first project in the list should be heroed in the page so it is larger.

- [ ] Each project shows title description and key details
- [ ] Projects include links to live demos or repositories
- [ ] Projects page is fully responsive
- [ ] Projects use Nuxt UI components for consistent styling
- [ ] Projects page includes filtering or categorization if needed
