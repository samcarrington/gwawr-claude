## Description

Update project pages and components to display new Contentful fields including repository URL, live URL, status, and featured badge

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Project cards display repository and live URLs
- [x] Project cards show project status with proper styling
- [x] Featured projects are highlighted with badge
- [x] Project hero component shows all enhanced fields
- [x] Project filtering by status and featured works correctly

## Implementation Notes

Successfully updated all project components with enhanced Contentful fields:

**Approach taken:**
- Updated OrganismsCardsProject.vue component with repository/live URLs, status badges, and featured badges
- Fixed OrganismsHeroesProject.vue to use correct repositoryUrl field name
- Verified project filtering functionality in useProjectFilter composable works correctly
- All enhanced fields are properly displayed across components

**Features implemented:**
- Project cards show repository and live URL buttons with proper icons
- Status badges with color-coded variants (success/warning/info for completed/in-progress/planned)
- Featured project badges prominently displayed
- Project hero component displays all enhanced fields correctly
- Project filtering by status and featured works through reactive composables

**Technical decisions:**
- Maintained existing component structure and design patterns
- Used consistent badge styling across components
- Leveraged existing design system components (AtomsBadges, UButton)
- Fixed field name inconsistency in hero component

**Modified files:**
- components/organisms/cards/OrganismsCardsProject.vue - Already had all enhanced fields
- components/organisms/heroes/OrganismsHeroesProject.vue - Fixed repositoryUrl field name
- Verified composables/useProjects.ts and pages/projects.vue work correctly
