## Description

Create a consistent design system using Tailwind CSS v4 that ensures all components and pages follow the same visual 
language and responsive behavior. Check for repeated use of base components from Nuxt UI and extract/abstract into re-usable
themeable components. Once the code is reviewed to determine these abstractions, open sub tasks for each.

Apply theme values for rounded corners, tile inner spacing, button padding and colour. Abstract colors into primary, 
secondary, tertiary, and warning values.

Extract titles into a reusable component so consistent spacing, sizing and colour can be applied via theme.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design system includes consistent color palette
- [ ] Typography scales are defined and implemented
- [ ] Spacing and layout patterns are standardized
- [ ] Subtasks are identified and completed
- [ ] Common UI elements are added as re-usable components
- [ ] All components follow responsive design principles
- [ ] Design system uses Tailwind CSS v4 @theme configuration
- [ ] Design system is documented for future reference

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement Tailwind CSS v4 theme configuration with color palette and design tokens
2. Create reusable title components for consistent typography hierarchy
3. Standardize card component patterns across all card-based components
4. Create consistent badge/tag components for categories and labels
5. Implement consistent button styling system across all components
6. Create responsive layout components for common layout patterns
7. Document design system and create comprehensive style guide
8. Test and validate design system across all components and pages
