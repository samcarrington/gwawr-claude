## Description

Create a consistent design system using Tailwind CSS v4 that ensures all components and pages follow the same visual 
language and responsive behavior. Check for repeated use of base components from Nuxt UI and extract/abstract into re-usable
themeable components. Once the code is reviewed to determine these abstractions, open sub tasks for each.

Apply theme values for rounded corners, tile inner spacing, button padding and colour. Abstract colors into primary, 
secondary, tertiary, and warning values.

Extract titles into a reusable component so consistent spacing, sizing and colour can be applied via theme.

- [ ] Subtasks are identified and completed
