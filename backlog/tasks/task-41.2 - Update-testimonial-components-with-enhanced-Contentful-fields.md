## Description

Update testimonial pages and components to display new Contentful fields including rating, client information, and featured status

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Testimonial cards display client rating with stars
- [x] Client title and company information shown properly
- [x] Featured testimonials are highlighted
- [x] Testimonial filtering by rating and featured works
- [x] All client information displays correctly

## Resolution Summary

**Completed:** Successfully updated testimonial components and pages to use enhanced Contentful fields with full RichText content processing.

**Root Cause Identified & Fixed:**
The testimonial content was empty because the transformer was looking for `content` or `testimonialText` fields, but Contentful stores testimonial quotes in a `quote` field as RichText format.

**Key Technical Changes:**
1. **Fixed Content Field Mapping**: Updated `transformTestimonial` to use `quote` field instead of missing `content` field
2. **RichText Processing**: Implemented proper RichText rendering using `renderContent()` function with paragraph tag stripping
3. **Async Transformation**: Made `transformTestimonial` and `transformTestimonials` async to handle RichText processing
4. **API Updates**: Updated testimonials and featured testimonials APIs to await async transformers
5. **Page Integration**: Replaced mock data with direct `useFetch` calls for reliable Contentful integration
6. **Enhanced Component**: Updated `OrganismsCardsTestimonial` to handle both legacy and enhanced field names
7. **Featured Testimonials Section**: Added dedicated section with featured badges and enhanced styling
8. **Filtering Controls**: Implemented rating filter (3+, 4+, 5 stars) and featured-only toggle
9. **Error Handling**: Added proper loading, error, and no-results states

- ✅ Created comprehensive test suites for testimonial transformers
