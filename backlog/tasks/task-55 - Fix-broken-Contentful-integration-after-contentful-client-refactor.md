## Description

**RESOLVED**: The Contentful integration was failing due to incorrect query structure for linked fields, not missing dependencies. The system was falling back to mock data because Contentful API queries were malformed for Object-type fields.

### Root Cause Analysis (Updated)

After thorough investigation, the real issue was identified:

1. **Contentful Query Structure Issue**: 
   - `server/api/projects.get.ts` was querying `fields.category` directly as a string
   - In Contentful, `category` is defined as "Array of Links to projectCategory" (Object type)
   - Error: "The equals operator cannot be used on fields.category.en-US because it has type Object"

2. **Environment Variables Were Configured**:
   - All Contentful environment variables were properly set
   - The integration was working, but queries were failing due to incorrect syntax

3. **API Endpoint Fallback Behavior**:
   - `server/api/projects.get.ts` was correctly falling back to mock data on query errors
   - This masked the real issue until the actual error was examined

### Solution Implemented

1. **Fixed Contentful Query Structure**:
   - Added `include: 2` parameter to resolve linked entries
   - Implemented client-side filtering for linked fields (category)
   - Maintained server-side filtering for simple fields (status, featured)

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added proper null checks for transformed projects
   - Improved client-side filtering logic with safety checks

### Impact

- **Projects page**: Shows mock data instead of real Contentful projects
- **Blog posts**: Likely affected by same integration issues
- **Testimonials**: Likely affected by same integration issues
- **Filter functionality**: Works with mock data but not real data
- **Content management**: Cannot update content through Contentful CMS

### Current Workaround

The system gracefully falls back to mock data, so the site functions but doesn't reflect real content from Contentful.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- [x] **~~Create or restore missing Contentful client utility~~** (NOT NEEDED)
  - [x] ~~Create `utils/contentful-client.ts` with `getContentfulClient()` function~~ (Issue was query structure, not missing client)
  - [x] ~~Function should create and return configured Contentful client instance~~ (Direct client usage was working)
  - [x] ~~Use environment variables from Nuxt runtime config~~ (Environment variables were properly configured)
  - [x] ~~Handle both CDN and Preview API configurations~~ (Configuration was correct)

- [x] **~~Fix ContentfulService integration~~** (NOT NEEDED)
  - [x] ~~Update `services/contentfulService.ts` to use restored client utility~~ (Service layer was not the issue)
  - [x] ~~Ensure all ContentfulService methods work with real Contentful client~~ (Client was working)
  - [x] ~~Maintain existing API interface for backward compatibility~~ (No changes needed)

- [x] **Update API endpoints to handle Contentful query structure correctly**
  - [x] Fixed `server/api/projects.get.ts` Contentful query structure for linked fields
  - [x] Added `include: 2` parameter to resolve linked entries (category, technologies)
  - [x] Implemented client-side filtering for Object-type fields (category)
  - [x] Maintained server-side filtering for simple fields (status, featured)
  - [x] Enhanced error handling with proper null checks
  - [x] Ensured graceful fallback to mock data on Contentful failures

- [x] **Verify environment configuration integration**
  - [x] Confirmed runtime config properly reads all Contentful environment variables
  - [x] Verified development configuration works correctly
  - [x] Ensured proper error messages when Contentful queries fail

### Functional Requirements
- [x] **Projects integration works end-to-end**
  - [x] Projects page displays real Contentful data instead of mock data
  - [x] Filter functionality works with real project data from Contentful
  - [x] Project categories and statuses reflect actual Contentful content
  - [ ] Project detail pages work with real Contentful data (not tested in this task)

- [ ] **Other content types work (if affected)**
  - [ ] Blog posts display real Contentful data (not addressed in this task - separate issue)
  - [ ] Testimonials display real Contentful data (not addressed in this task - separate issue)
  - [ ] All content filtering and pagination works with real data (projects only completed)

- [x] **Graceful error handling**
  - [x] System falls back to mock data when Contentful is unavailable
  - [x] Clear error messages in server logs when Contentful fails
  - [x] No client-side errors when Contentful integration fails

### Testing Requirements
- [x] **~~Unit tests for Contentful client utility~~** (NOT NEEDED)
  - [x] ~~Test client initialization with valid configuration~~ (Direct client usage confirmed working)
  - [x] ~~Test error handling with invalid configuration~~ (Error handling verified through manual testing)
  - [x] ~~Test environment variable integration~~ (Environment integration confirmed working)

- [ ] **Integration tests for ContentfulService** (DEFERRED)
  - [ ] Test all service methods with mocked Contentful client (not addressed - service layer not modified)
  - [ ] Test error handling and transformation logic (not addressed - separate concern)
  - [ ] Test fallback behavior when Contentful is unavailable (not addressed - separate concern)

- [x] **API endpoint tests** (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
  - [x] Verified API endpoints return real Contentful data when available (manual testing confirmed)
  - [x] Verified fallback to mock data when Contentful fails (existing behavior preserved)
  - [x] Verified filtering and pagination with real data (manual testing confirmed)

- [x] **E2E tests** (MANUAL VERIFICATION COMPLETED)
  - [x] Verified complete user journey with real Contentful data (projects page working)
  - [x] Verified filter persistence with real data (filter functionality confirmed working)
  - [ ] Test content updates reflect on frontend (not tested - separate concern)

### Documentation Requirements
- [x] **Update technical documentation** (COMPLETED IN TASK)
  - [x] ~~Document the restored Contentful client utility~~ (No utility was restored - documented actual fix)
  - [x] Documented actual Contentful query structure fix in this task
  - [x] Documented environment variable requirements (confirmed working)

- [ ] **Update deployment documentation** (NOT NEEDED FOR THIS TASK)
  - [x] Deployment guides already include Contentful configuration (confirmed working)
  - [x] Documented troubleshooting steps for Contentful query structure issues (in this task)
