## Description

Refine and enhance the design of the project detail pages to improve visual hierarchy, user experience, and overall presentation. While the basic functionality is working (task-56 and routing fix), the design needs refinement to create a more polished and engaging user experience.

### Background

The project detail pages are now fully functional with:
- Working routing (`/projects/[slug]`)
- Contentful integration for dynamic content
- Navigation from project tiles to detail pages
- Basic layout with loading states and error handling

However, the design needs enhancement to better showcase projects and provide an optimal user experience.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Design Analysis**
   - Review current project detail page layout
   - Identify areas for improvement
   - Create design mockups or wireframes

2. **Component Enhancement**
   - Update project detail page components
   - Implement new design patterns
   - Add enhanced visual elements

3. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test across different devices and screen sizes
   - Validate accessibility compliance
