## Description

Standardize responsive layout patterns with reusable components for common layouts (hero sections, feature grids, content sections) ensuring consistent spacing and breakpoint behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hero section layout component created
- [ ] Feature grid layout component created
- [ ] Content section layout component created
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints standardized
- [ ] Layout spacing controlled via theme configuration
- [ ] All existing layouts refactored to use new components
- [ ] Layout components support different variants and configurations
- [ ] Unit tests created for all layout components

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing page layouts to identify common patterns
2. Create hero section layout component with multiple variants and configurations
3. Create feature grid layout component with responsive behavior and customizable columns
4. Create content section layout component with flexible content alignment and styling
5. Standardize responsive breakpoints and layout tokens in theme configuration
6. Create comprehensive unit tests for all layout components
7. Refactor existing page layouts to use new standardized components

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive responsive layout components for standardized page layouts. Created three main layout components:

1. **TemplatesLayoutsHero**: Hero section component with multiple variants (gradient, solid, image), sizes (small, medium, large, fullscreen), and background options. Supports custom title, subtitle, actions, and content slots with flexible alignment and overlay options.

2. **TemplatesLayoutsGrid**: Feature grid component with responsive behavior, customizable columns (1-6), gap sizes, and background variants. Includes header/footer slots, content alignment options, and automatic responsive breakpoints.

3. **TemplatesLayoutsSection**: Content section component with flexible alignment, max-width constraints, variants (default, featured, highlight), and comprehensive styling options including borders, backgrounds, and padding controls.

4. **@theme.ts**: Standardized responsive breakpoints, spacing scale, layout constraints, grid systems, and design tokens for consistent theming across all components.

5. **Comprehensive unit tests**: Created full test suites for all layout components with 48 passing tests covering props, slots, styling, and responsive behavior.

All components follow atomic design principles with cascade naming convention and are fully integrated with the existing design system. Components support theme-based styling and provide flexible configuration options for different layout needs.
