- [x] Nuxt UI is installed and configured
- [x] Project has proper package.json with all dependencies
- [x] Development server starts without errors
- [x] README.md contains setup and build instructions

## Implementation Plan

1. Check current project structure and existing files
2. Initialize Nuxt.js project with proper configuration
3. Install and configure Tailwind CSS v4 following decision-1
4. Install and configure Nuxt UI following decision-2
5. Create basic project structure and files
6. Test that development server starts successfully
7. Update README.md with setup and build instructions

## Implementation Notes

Successfully set up Nuxt.js boilerplate with Tailwind CSS v4 and Nuxt UI. Key accomplishments:
- Initialized Nuxt 3 project with proper dependencies
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 using @import syntax and Vite plugin
- Integrated Nuxt UI for component library
- Created main.css with v4 configuration
- Verified build process works correctly
- Updated README.md with comprehensive setup instructions

Technical decisions:
- Removed @nuxtjs/tailwindcss module due to v4 incompatibility
- Used @tailwindcss/vite plugin directly
- Disabled devtools to avoid initialization issues
- Followed decision-1 and decision-2 guidelines
