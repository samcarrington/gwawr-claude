## Description

Replace brittle hardcoded sleep and job control syntax in test:dev npm script with robust cross-platform solution. Implement proper dev server readiness detection before running tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hardcoded sleep removed from test:dev script
- [ ] Job control syntax (%1) replaced with cross-platform solution
- [ ] Dev server readiness detection implemented
- [ ] wait-on or similar tool integrated for server polling
- [ ] Test script works consistently across macOS Linux and Windows
- [ ] Process management improved for reliable cleanup
- [ ] Documentation updated for cross-platform testing approach

## Implementation Plan

1. Research cross-platform solutions for dev server readiness detection
2. Evaluate wait-on vs concurrently vs custom polling solutions
3. Install and configure chosen tool (likely wait-on)
4. Replace hardcoded sleep with proper server readiness polling
5. Implement cross-platform process management for cleanup
6. Test solution across different operating systems
7. Update documentation with new testing approach
8. Remove brittle job control syntax and timing dependencies
