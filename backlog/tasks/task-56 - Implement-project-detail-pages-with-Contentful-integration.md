## Description

Implement individual project detail pages that display comprehensive project information from Contentful. While the projects listing page now works correctly with real Contentful data (task-55), individual project detail pages need to be created to show full project information.

### Background

Task-55 successfully fixed the projects listing integration, but project detail pages were marked as "not tested in this task". Users need to be able to click on projects from the listing to view detailed information including:
- Full project description and content
- Complete technology stack
- Project images/screenshots
- Live demo and repository links
- Project timeline and status

### Scope

1. **Create project detail page route** (`/projects/[slug]`)
2. **Implement API endpoint** for individual project fetching
3. **Create project detail component** with comprehensive layout
4. **Handle Contentful rich text content** rendering
5. **Implement proper SEO** and meta tags
6. **Add navigation** between projects

## Acceptance Criteria
