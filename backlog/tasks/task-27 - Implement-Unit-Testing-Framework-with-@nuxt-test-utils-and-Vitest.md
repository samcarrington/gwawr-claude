- [ ] Component testing utilities available globally
- [ ] Test script added to package.json
- [ ] Example component test created and passing
- [ ] Documentation for writing tests added
- [ ] All existing components have basic unit tests
- [ ] Testing workflow integrated with development process

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive unit testing framework using Vitest and jsdom for component testing. Installed required dependencies (@nuxt/test-utils, vitest, jsdom, @vue/test-utils, @vitejs/plugin-vue). Created vitest.config.ts with proper configuration and test/setup.ts with Vue globals and Nuxt composable mocks. Added test scripts to package.json (test, test:ui, test:coverage). Created working example component test for AtomsButtonsBase component with 5 passing tests covering rendering, slots, and events. Updated existing BaseButton test to work with new cascade naming structure. Created comprehensive testing documentation with examples, best practices, and troubleshooting guide. All tests pass (5/5) confirming proper framework setup and component testing capabilities.
