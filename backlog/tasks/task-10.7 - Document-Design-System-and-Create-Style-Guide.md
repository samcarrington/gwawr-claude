## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for the design system including component usage, theme configuration, and development guidelines. Ensure the design system is maintainable and extensible.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design system documentation created
- [ ] Component usage guide documented
- [ ] Theme configuration guide created
- [ ] Color palette and typography documented
- [ ] Spacing and layout guidelines documented
- [ ] Development guidelines for design system usage
- [ ] Style guide accessible to all team members
- [ ] Design system versioning and maintenance plan created
- [ ] Unit tests created for any documentation examples or demo components

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing design system components and documentation foundation
2. Create comprehensive design system guide with component usage patterns
3. Document all atomic design components with examples and props
4. Create theme configuration guide with color, typography, and spacing systems
5. Build interactive component showcase page for visual documentation
6. Write development guidelines for consistent component creation
7. Create practical usage examples and best practices guide
8. Establish versioning and maintenance plan for long-term sustainability

## Implementation Notes

Successfully created comprehensive design system documentation and style guide. 

**Documentation Created:**
1. **Design System Guide** (): 400+ line comprehensive guide covering all components, usage patterns, theme configuration, and development guidelines
2. **Interactive Showcase Page** (): Visual demonstration of all components with live examples
3. **Component Examples** (): Practical usage examples and best practices
4. **Enhanced Base Documentation** (): Updated with references to new comprehensive guides

**Key Features Documented:**
- **Complete Component Library**: All atomic design components (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates) with props, slots, and usage examples
- **Theme Configuration**: Comprehensive color system, typography scale, spacing system, and responsive breakpoints
- **Layout System**: Shared utilities, grid system, layout constraints, and responsive patterns
- **Development Guidelines**: Component creation standards, testing requirements, styling guidelines, and code quality standards
- **Maintenance Plan**: Versioning strategy, update process, breaking change management, and contribution guidelines

**Interactive Elements:**
- Live component demonstrations with all variants, sizes, and colors
- Color palette visualization with semantic color scales
- Typography hierarchy examples with proper usage context
- Layout pattern demonstrations with grid and hero components
- Real-world usage examples for complex component compositions

**Quality Assurance:**
- All existing tests continue to pass (74/74 tests passing)
- Documentation includes TypeScript examples with proper type safety
- Responsive design principles demonstrated throughout
- Accessibility considerations documented for all components
- Performance optimization guidelines included

The design system is now fully documented with comprehensive guides accessible to all team members, ensuring consistent implementation and maintainable codebase growth.
