## Description

Update the automated route testing script to handle dynamic blog post slugs from Contentful instead of hardcoded values. Implement dynamic content discovery for more robust and maintainable testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Route testing script updated to fetch available blog posts dynamically
- [ ] Hardcoded blog post slug removed from test-routes.sh
- [ ] Dynamic content discovery implemented for testing
- [ ] Test script works with any blog posts from Contentful
- [ ] Fallback testing strategy implemented for empty content
- [ ] Route testing remains reliable regardless of content changes

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current hardcoded blog post slug in test-routes.sh
2. Design dynamic content discovery approach using Contentful API
3. Implement function to fetch available blog post slugs from Contentful
4. Update test script to use first available blog post for testing
5. Add fallback strategy for when no blog posts exist
6. Test the dynamic approach with various content scenarios
7. Update documentation and remove hardcoded TODO comment
