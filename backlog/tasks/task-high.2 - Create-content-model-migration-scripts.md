- [x] Phase 2 data population script created for filling new fields
- [x] Phase 3 field requirements update script created
- [x] Phase 4 application integration checklist created
- [x] All scripts include proper error handling and validation
- [x] Backup and rollback procedures documented
- [x] Scripts tested in development environment
- [x] Migration timeline and execution plan finalized

## Implementation Notes

Created comprehensive migration script system with 4-phase approach. Phase 1: Content type enhancement (17 fields across 3 content types). Phase 2: Data population with intelligent defaults. Phase 3: Field requirements update (slug, repositoryUrl, rating). Phase 4: Application integration checklist. Includes migration orchestrator, backup/rollback procedures, and execution plan. All scripts use Node.js direct approach with environment variables for security.
