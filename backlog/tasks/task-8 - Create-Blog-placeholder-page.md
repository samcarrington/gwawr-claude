## Description

Build a placeholder page for a future blog section with appropriate messaging and layout structure that can be expanded later

If component structures in the placeholder page are visually similar or contain congruent content structures to existing components, add a subtask to refactor the component and include it in the change.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Blog page includes appropriate layout structure for future expansion
- [ ] Blog page is fully responsive
- [ ] Blog page uses consistent styling with rest of site
- [ ] Subtasks are complete
- [ ] Blog page includes placeholder content that sets expectations
- [ ] Blog page navigation works correctly
## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing blog.vue page structure and requirements
2. Create BlogCard component for blog post listings
3. Create comprehensive blog listing page with dummy data
4. Implement blog post categories and tags
5. Create wildcard route ([slug].vue) for individual blog posts
6. Design and implement individual blog post layout
7. Add blog navigation and SEO optimization
8. Test responsive design and accessibility
9. Identify and create subtasks for component reuse if applicable

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive blog placeholder pages with modern design and functionality:

**Components Created:**
- BlogCard.vue: Reusable blog post card component with hover effects, meta information, and responsive design
- Blog listing page (pages/blog/index.vue): Full-featured blog index with category filtering, featured posts, and search functionality
- Individual blog post page (pages/blog/[slug].vue): Complete article layout with related posts, social sharing, and SEO optimization

**Features Implemented:**
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Category-based filtering system
- Featured post highlighting
- Sample blog data with 6 realistic posts
- SEO metadata and Open Graph tags
- Social sharing functionality
- Related posts recommendations
- Proper error handling for non-existent posts
- Consistent styling with site theme
- CallToAction component integration

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used Vue 3 Composition API throughout
- Implemented proper Nuxt.js routing with wildcard routes
- Added accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Included placeholder content indicating future CMS integration
- Applied responsive design patterns with Tailwind CSS
- Used computed properties for efficient filtering and sorting

**Files Modified/Created:**
- pages/blog/index.vue (moved from pages/blog.vue)
- pages/blog/[slug].vue (new wildcard route)
- components/BlogCard.vue (new component)

The implementation provides a solid foundation for future blog functionality while maintaining design consistency and user experience standards.
