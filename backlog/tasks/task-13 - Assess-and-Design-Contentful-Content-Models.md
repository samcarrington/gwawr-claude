## Description

Analyze existing Contentful instance content models and design the required content models for projects, blog posts, 
testimonials, and other dynamic content. Document the gaps and plan the migration strategy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Current Contentful content models analyzed
- [ ] Project content model designed and documented
- [ ] Blog post content model designed and documented
- [ ] Testimonial content model designed and documented
- [ ] Content model migration plan created
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces created for all content models

## Implementation Plan

1. Use MCP server to analyze existing Contentful content types structure
2. Compare existing content models with application requirements
3. Design enhanced content model structures for blog posts, projects, and testimonials
4. Create comprehensive migration plan with phases and timelines
5. Document analysis findings and recommendations
6. Identify content gaps and transformation requirements
7. Create TypeScript interfaces for both current and enhanced structures

## Implementation Notes

Successfully completed comprehensive analysis of existing Contentful content types and designed enhanced content models. Key findings: 8 content types exist with 45 total entries, significant gaps identified in blogPost (missing slug, category, tags), project (missing URLs, featured status), and testimonial (missing rating, direct client fields) content types. Created detailed analysis report, migration plan, enhanced TypeScript interfaces, and transformation utilities. Migration plan includes 4 phases over 6 weeks with non-destructive approach. Files created: analysis-contentful-content-types.md, contentful-migration-plan.md, types/contentful-actual.ts, utils/contentful-transformers-updated.ts, contentful-analysis-summary.md.
