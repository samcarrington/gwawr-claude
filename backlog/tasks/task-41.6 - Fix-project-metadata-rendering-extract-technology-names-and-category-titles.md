## Description

Transform raw JSON project metadata into properly rendered technology names and project category titles instead of displaying raw JSON objects in lozenges and buttons

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No raw JSON displayed in project metadata
- [ ] Technology names properly extracted and displayed
- [ ] Project category titles correctly rendered
- [ ] No hydration mismatches between server and client
- [ ] Proper use of composables for data transformation
- [ ] Data transformers handle metadata extraction
- [ ] Services layer processes Contentful references correctly
- [ ] Error handling for missing or malformed metadata

## Implementation Notes

Successfully fixed project metadata rendering by implementing proper transformation functions:

**Approach taken:**
- Created extractTechnologyNames() function to handle both string arrays and Contentful entry references
- Created extractCategoryName() function to extract category titles from Contentful entries or strings  
- Created extractImageUrls() function to properly handle Contentful asset references
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation to transformProject function
- Updated project components to use computed properties for proper image handling

**Features implemented:**
- Technology names properly extracted from Contentful entries (fields.name)
- Project category titles correctly rendered from entry references
- Image URLs properly extracted from Contentful assets
- Error handling for missing or malformed metadata
- SSR-safe computed properties for image rendering
- Filtered out null transformation results

**Technical decisions:**
- Used defensive programming with proper null checks and fallbacks
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing string-based data
- Added console warnings for debugging malformed data
- Used computed properties to ensure SSR/client hydration consistency

**Modified files:**
- utils/contentful-transformers.ts - Enhanced project transformation with proper metadata extraction
- components/organisms/cards/OrganismsCardsProject.vue - Fixed image property and added computed projectImage
- components/organisms/heroes/OrganismsHeroesProject.vue - Fixed image property and added TypeScript types

Successfully fixed project metadata rendering and hydration mismatch issues:

**Approach taken:**
- Enhanced transformer functions to prevent JSON output by using safe fallbacks
- Fixed hydration mismatch by enabling server-side rendering in useProjectFilter
- Removed conflicting client-side transformations that were interfering with server transformations
- Added comprehensive error logging for debugging malformed Contentful data

**Features implemented:**
- Category names properly extracted with 'Uncategorized' fallback instead of JSON
- Technology names properly extracted with 'Unknown Technology' fallback instead of JSON
- Enhanced error logging to identify malformed Contentful entries
- Fixed server-side rendering to prevent hydration mismatches
- Consistent data transformation across server and client

**Technical decisions:**
- Used safe fallbacks ('Uncategorized', 'Unknown Technology') instead of JSON.stringify()
- Enabled server-side rendering (server: true) to fix hydration mismatch
- Removed client-side transformations that were conflicting with server transformations
- Added detailed console warnings for debugging malformed data

**Modified files:**
- utils/contentful-transformers.ts - Added safe fallbacks for category and technology extraction
- composables/useProjects.ts - Fixed hydration mismatch by enabling SSR and removing conflicting client transforms
