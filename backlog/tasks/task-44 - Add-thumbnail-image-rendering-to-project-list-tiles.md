## Description

Find and display the thumbnail image for each project in the project list page tiles to improve visual presentation and user experience

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project tiles display thumbnail images
- [ ] Images are properly sized and responsive
- [ ] Fallback handling for missing images
- [ ] Images load efficiently without performance issues
## Implementation Plan

1. Examine existing project card component image handling\n2. Verify that projectImage computed property works correctly\n3. Ensure images array is properly populated from Contentful\n4. Test thumbnail display in project list\n5. Add fallback handling for missing images

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented thumbnail image rendering for project tiles:\n\n**Approach taken:**\n- Verified existing projectImage computed property in OrganismsCardsProject component\n- Enhanced extractImageUrls function in contentful-transformers.ts to handle Contentful assets\n- Project tiles already had proper image handling with MoleculesCardsImage component\n- Images are responsive with aspect-ratio="video" and proper fallback icons\n\n**Features implemented:**\n- Project tiles display first image from images array as thumbnail\n- Images are properly sized and responsive using aspect-ratio utilities\n- Fallback handling with i-heroicons-photo icon for missing images\n- Efficient loading through Contentful asset URL transformation\n- getAssetUrl function supports width, height, quality, and format optimizations\n\n**Technical decisions:**\n- Used existing computed property pattern for SSR compatibility\n- Leveraged Contentful's image transformation API for optimization\n- Maintained consistent fallback UI with design system icons\n\n**Modified files:**\n- utils/contentful-transformers.ts - Enhanced extractImageUrls and getAssetUrl functions
