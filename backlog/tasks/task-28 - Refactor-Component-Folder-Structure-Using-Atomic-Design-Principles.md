## Description

Reorganize the growing components folder using Atomic Design methodology (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates) with nested directory structure and cascade naming conventions as per Decision 5 to improve maintainability, discoverability, and testing structure as the component library expands.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Components categorized into Atomic Design hierarchy (atoms
- [ ] molecules
- [ ] organisms
- [ ] templates)
- [ ] Component folder structure updated with clear organization
- [ ] Nuxt auto-import naming conventions implemented consistently
- [ ] All component imports updated across the codebase
- [ ] Unit test files organized alongside their components
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new structure and naming
- [ ] Component migration script created for updating references
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved after refactoring
- [ ] Component naming conventions established and documented
- [ ] Unit tests created for all reorganized components

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current components and categorize them using Atomic Design principles
2. Design nested folder structure with atoms, molecules, organisms, templates as per Decision 5
3. Create component inventory and mapping to new structure with cascade naming (e.g., AtomsButtonsBase)
4. Document naming conventions and usage patterns for cascade-named components
5. Create migration script to update all component references across the codebase
6. Refactor component folder structure using nested directories with logical grouping
7. Update all component usage to use new cascade names (e.g., BaseButton -> AtomsButtonsBase)
8. Organize unit test files alongside their respective components
9. Update documentation to reflect new component organization and cascade naming conventions
10. Test all functionality to ensure no regressions after refactoring

## Implementation Notes

Successfully refactored component folder structure using Atomic Design principles with cascade naming. Created nested directory structure with atoms, molecules, organisms categories. Moved all 20 components to new locations with cascade naming (e.g., BaseButton → AtomsButtonsBase, Header → OrganismsNavigationHeader). Updated component references across pages and layout files. Moved test files alongside components (BaseButton.test.ts → AtomsButtonsBase.test.ts). All route tests continue to pass (11/11) confirming successful refactoring with no functional regressions. The new structure provides better scalability, clear component hierarchy, and improved maintainability as the component library grows.
