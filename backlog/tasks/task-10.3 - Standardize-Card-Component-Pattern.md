## Description

Create a base Card component that encapsulates repeated card patterns (rounded corners, shadows, padding, hover states) used across BlogCard, ProjectCard, SkillCard, and TestimonialCard.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] BaseCard component created with consistent styling
- [ ] Card padding and border radius standardized
- [ ] Card shadow and hover effects unified
- [ ] All existing card components refactored to use BaseCard
- [ ] Card component supports different variants and sizes
- [ ] Card styling controlled via theme configuration
- [ ] Card component is fully responsive
- [ ] Repeated code is simplified or eliminated - keep it DRY and separate concerns

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing card patterns across BlogCard, ProjectCard, SkillCard, and TestimonialCard components
2. Create BaseCard component with theme configuration for consistent styling (variants, sizes, padding, hover effects)
3. Create CardImage component to DRY up repeated image header patterns with fallback icons and category badges
4. Create TagList component to DRY up repeated tag/technology list patterns with different variants and alignments
5. Refactor all existing card components to use BaseCard and specialized components
6. Test changes to ensure consistent styling and responsive behavior
7. Commit changes with comprehensive documentation
