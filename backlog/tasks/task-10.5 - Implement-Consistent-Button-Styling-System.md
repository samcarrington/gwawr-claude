## Description

Standardize UButton usage across components with consistent padding, colors, and variants. Create theme-based button configurations and ensure all buttons follow the same design language.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Button padding and sizing standardized via theme
- [ ] Button color variants defined (primary secondary outline)
- [ ] Button styling consistent across all components
- [ ] Icon button patterns standardized
- [ ] Button hover and focus states unified
- [ ] All existing buttons refactored to use theme configuration
- [ ] Button accessibility improved with consistent focus styles

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing button patterns across components
2. Create BaseButton component with theme configuration and icon slots
3. Create app.config.ts with comprehensive UButton styling for all color variants
4. Create ButtonPrimary and ButtonSecondary wrapper components
5. Refactor all existing buttons to use new component system
6. Test changes to ensure consistent styling and functionality

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented consistent button styling system with BaseButton component and comprehensive theme configuration. Created BaseButton component with named slots for leading/trailing icons, eliminating the need for separate icon button components. Configured app.config.ts with complete UButton styling for all color variants (primary, secondary, tertiary, success, warning, error, neutral) and all variants (solid, outline, soft, ghost, link). Created ButtonPrimary and ButtonSecondary wrapper components as parameterized versions of BaseButton. Refactored all existing buttons across Header, index page, ProjectHero, projects page, and blog index to use the new component system. All buttons now have consistent padding, sizing, focus states, and accessibility improvements. All route tests pass (11/11) confirming proper functionality and no regressions.
