## Description

Standardize the repeated badge/tag patterns used for categories, technologies, and labels across the application with consistent styling and theme-based colors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Badge component created with consistent styling
- [ ] Tag component created for technology labels
- [ ] Badge supports different variants (primary secondary accent)
- [ ] Tag styling standardized across all components
- [ ] Color variants controlled via theme configuration
- [ ] Badge and tag components are accessible
- [ ] All existing badges/tags refactored to use new components

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing badge/tag patterns used across the application
2. Create Badge component with consistent styling and multiple variants (primary, secondary, tertiary, success, warning, error)
3. Enhance TagList component to support additional variants and outline style
4. Refactor CardImage component to use Badge component instead of hardcoded category badges
5. Ensure all badge styling is controlled via theme configuration
6. Test changes to ensure consistent styling and accessibility
7. Commit changes with comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Notes

Successfully created consistent Badge and TagList components for standardized badge/tag patterns. Created Badge component with multiple variants (primary, secondary, tertiary, success, warning, error), sizes (xs, sm, md, lg), and support for outline style. Enhanced TagList component with additional variants and outline support. Refactored CardImage component to use Badge instead of hardcoded category badges. All styling controlled via theme configuration with consistent color palette. Components are accessible with proper contrast and semantic markup. All automated tests pass (11/11) confirming proper implementation and no regressions.

Successfully created consistent Badge and TagList components for standardized badge/tag patterns, then optimized all components to use design system tokens instead of hardcoded colors. Created Badge component with multiple variants (primary, secondary, tertiary, success, warning, error), sizes (xs, sm, md, lg), and support for outline style. Enhanced TagList component with additional variants and outline support. Added Success and Neutral color palettes to the design system with full 50-950 scales. Replaced all hardcoded Tailwind colors (bg-gray-*, border-green-*, etc.) with design system tokens across Badge, TagList, BaseTitle, and BaseCard components. All styling now controlled via theme configuration enabling easy theme changes and consistent visual updates. Components are accessible with proper contrast and semantic markup. All automated tests pass (11/11) confirming proper implementation and no regressions.
