## Description

Standardize the repeated badge/tag patterns used for categories, technologies, and labels across the application with consistent styling and theme-based colors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Badge component created with consistent styling
- [ ] Tag component created for technology labels
- [ ] Badge supports different variants (primary secondary accent)
- [ ] Tag styling standardized across all components
- [ ] Color variants controlled via theme configuration
- [ ] Badge and tag components are accessible
- [ ] All existing badges/tags refactored to use new components

## Implementation Plan

2. Create Badge component with consistent styling and multiple variants (primary, secondary, tertiary, success, warning, error)
3. Enhance TagList component to support additional variants and outline style
4. Refactor CardImage component to use Badge component instead of hardcoded category badges
5. Ensure all badge styling is controlled via theme configuration
6. Test changes to ensure consistent styling and accessibility
7. Commit changes with comprehensive documentation
