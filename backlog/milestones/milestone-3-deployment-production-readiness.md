# milestone-3 - Deployment and Production Readiness

## Description

Prepare the application for production deployment on Netlify or Vercel, implementing all necessary configurations, optimizations, and monitoring tools for a reliable, scalable, and performant live website.

## Goal

Successfully deploy the CMS-integrated website to production with proper CI/CD, monitoring, security, and performance optimizations in place.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Deployment platform selected (Netlify or Vercel)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured and functional
- [ ] Environment variables and secrets management
- [ ] Production build optimization implemented
- [ ] CDN configuration and edge caching
- [ ] Custom domain configured with SSL
- [ ] Error tracking and monitoring setup
- [ ] Performance monitoring implemented
- [ ] Security headers and best practices applied
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery plan
- [ ] Load testing completed successfully
- [ ] SEO and meta tags optimized for production

## Dependencies

- milestone-2 - Headless CMS Integration (must be completed)

## Associated Tasks

- Compare and select deployment platform (Netlify vs Vercel)
- Set up deployment configuration and build settings
- Configure environment variables for production
- Implement build optimization and bundle analysis
- Set up CDN and edge caching strategies
- Configure custom domain and SSL certificates
- Implement error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- Set up performance monitoring and analytics
- Configure security headers and CSP
- Create backup and recovery procedures
- Perform load testing and optimization
- Set up staging environment for testing
- Document deployment and rollback procedures

## Timeline

**Target Completion**: 2-3 weeks after milestone-2
**Priority**: High

## Success Metrics

- Zero deployment failures
- Page load times < 2 seconds globally
- 99.9% uptime achieved
- Lighthouse scores > 95% across all metrics
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Automated deployments successful
- Monitoring alerts functional
- Disaster recovery tested and documented

## Technical Considerations

- Choose platform based on CMS integration capabilities
- Implement proper caching strategies for dynamic content
- Configure edge functions for dynamic features
- Set up proper monitoring and alerting
- Plan for traffic scaling and load balancing
- Consider geographic content delivery optimization
- Implement proper secret management and security practices
