## Context

During the implementation of Contentful content model migration (tasks high.1, medium.1, medium.2, high.2), we executed the individual migration phases before creating the comprehensive orchestrator, backup, and rollback procedures. This approach created several issues:

### Problems Identified:

1. **No Comprehensive Backup**: Individual tasks were executed without complete pre-migration backups
2. **No Centralized Orchestration**: Each migration was run independently without unified logging or error handling
3. **Limited Rollback Capability**: Rollback procedures were created after execution, not before
4. **Risk Management**: Higher risk exposure due to lack of safety infrastructure
5. **Process Consistency**: Different execution approaches across similar tasks

### Execution Order That Occurred:
1. ✅ task-high.1 (blogPost enhancement) - Executed individually
2. ✅ task-medium.1 (project enhancement) - Executed individually  
3. ✅ task-medium.2 (testimonial enhancement) - Executed individually
4. ✅ task-high.2 (migration scripts) - Created orchestrator AFTER individual executions

### Problems This Created:
- **Retroactive Safety**: Safety measures created after risk exposure
- **Incomplete Documentation**: Migration logs scattered across individual executions

2. ✅ task-medium.1 (project enhancement) - Executed individually  
3. ✅ task-medium.2 (testimonial enhancement) - Executed individually
4. ✅ task-high.2 (migration scripts) - Created orchestrator AFTER individual executions

### Problems This Created:
- **Retroactive Safety**: Safety measures created after risk exposure
- **Incomplete Documentation**: Migration logs scattered across individual executions
- **Inconsistent Approach**: Different execution methods across similar tasks
- **Recovery Complexity**: Harder to implement comprehensive rollback after piecemeal execution

## Decision

We will implement an **Infrastructure-First Migration Approach** for all future complex migration work:

### **Migration Infrastructure Development Order:**

1. **FIRST: Safety Infrastructure**
   - Create comprehensive backup procedures
   - Create rollback scripts for each phase
   - Create monitoring and validation scripts
   - Test rollback procedures in development

2. **SECOND: Orchestration Infrastructure**
   - Create migration orchestrator with unified logging
   - Create execution plan with clear phases
   - Create verification procedures for each phase
   - Test orchestration in development environment

3. **THIRD: Individual Migration Components**
   - Create individual migration scripts
   - Integrate with orchestrator
   - Test individual components within orchestration framework
   - Document dependencies and execution order

4. **FOURTH: Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test complete migration pipeline in development
   - Verify backup and rollback procedures work
   - Test orchestration handles errors correctly
   - Validate all monitoring and logging

5. **FIFTH: Production Execution**
   - Execute with full safety infrastructure in place
   - Use orchestrator for consistent execution
   - Monitor with established procedures
   - Document results for future reference

### **Implementation Principles:**

#### **Infrastructure-First Principle**
- Never execute production migrations without complete safety infrastructure
- Always create backup and rollback procedures BEFORE execution
- Always test rollback procedures BEFORE production execution

#### **Orchestration-First Principle**
- Use centralized orchestration for all complex migrations
- Maintain unified logging and monitoring
- Ensure consistent execution approach across all phases

#### **Test-Safety-First Principle**
- Test all safety procedures in development first
- Verify rollback procedures work before production
- Validate monitoring and alerting before production

## Implementation Guidelines

### **For Future Migration Tasks:**

#### **Task Structure:**
```
Migration Epic
├── Task 1: Create Safety Infrastructure
│   ├── Backup procedures
│   ├── Rollback scripts
│   └── Monitoring setup
├── Task 2: Create Orchestration Infrastructure
│   ├── Migration orchestrator
│   ├── Execution plan
│   └── Verification procedures
├── Task 3: Create Migration Components
│   ├── Individual migration scripts
│   ├── Integration with orchestrator
│   └── Component testing
├── Task 4: Comprehensive Testing
│   ├── End-to-end testing
│   ├── Rollback validation
│   └── Performance verification
└── Task 5: Production Execution
    ├── Orchestrated execution
    ├── Real-time monitoring
    └── Post-execution verification
```

#### **Task Dependencies:**
- Task 2 depends on Task 1 (orchestration needs safety)
- Task 3 depends on Task 2 (components need orchestration)
- Task 4 depends on Task 3 (testing needs components)
- Task 5 depends on Task 4 (production needs validated testing)

#### **Definition of Ready:**
Before any migration task can be marked "In Progress":
- [ ] Backup procedures exist and are tested
- [ ] Rollback procedures exist and are tested
- [ ] Orchestration framework is in place
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting is configured
- [ ] Testing environment mirrors production

#### **Definition of Done:**
Before any migration task can be marked "Done":
- [ ] All safety infrastructure is in place
- [ ] All procedures have been tested
- [ ] All documentation is complete
- [ ] All monitoring shows healthy state
- [ ] All rollback procedures are validated

## Examples

### **Correct Approach (Future):**
```
Epic: Database Schema Migration
├── Task 1: Create DB Migration Safety Infrastructure
├── Task 2: Create DB Migration Orchestrator
├── Task 3: Create Individual Schema Changes
├── Task 4: Test Complete Migration Pipeline
└── Task 5: Execute Production Migration
```

### **Incorrect Approach (What We Did):**
```
Epic: Contentful Migration
├── Task 1: Execute blogPost Enhancement ❌
├── Task 2: Execute project Enhancement ❌
├── Task 3: Execute testimonial Enhancement ❌
└── Task 4: Create Safety Infrastructure ❌ (Too Late)
```

## Rationale

### **Risk Mitigation:**
- **Reduced Risk**: Safety infrastructure in place before execution
- **Faster Recovery**: Tested rollback procedures ready
- **Better Monitoring**: Unified logging and alerting
- **Consistency**: Same approach across all migrations

### **Quality Improvement:**
- **Better Testing**: Complete pipeline testing before production
- **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation before execution
- **Better Coordination**: Orchestrated execution reduces human error
- **Better Learning**: Consistent approach enables process improvement

### **Operational Excellence:**
- **Predictable Execution**: Well-defined process reduces surprises
- **Scalable Approach**: Framework can be reused for future migrations
- **Team Confidence**: Proven safety measures increase team confidence
- **Compliance**: Better audit trail and documentation

## Implementation for Current State

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Document Current State**: Create comprehensive documentation of executed migrations
2. **Create Retroactive Safety**: Implement backup and rollback procedures for current state
3. **Validate Current State**: Verify all migrations executed successfully
4. **Test Rollback**: Validate rollback procedures work with current state

### **Future Work:**
1. **Apply This Decision**: Use infrastructure-first approach for all future migrations
2. **Create Templates**: Create reusable templates for migration infrastructure
3. **Team Training**: Train team on new approach and decision rationale
4. **Process Documentation**: Update process documentation to reflect new approach

## Compliance Checklist

For all future migration work, verify:
- [ ] **Safety First**: Backup and rollback procedures created and tested
- [ ] **Orchestration Ready**: Migration orchestrator created and tested  
- [ ] **Components Integrated**: Individual components work with orchestrator
- [ ] **Testing Complete**: End-to-end testing completed successfully
- [ ] **Documentation Complete**: All procedures documented and reviewed
- [ ] **Team Alignment**: All team members understand the approach
