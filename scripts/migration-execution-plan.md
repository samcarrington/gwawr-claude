## Pre-Migration Checklist

### Environment Setup

- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Verify `.env` file contains:
  ```
  CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id
  CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=your_management_token
  CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=master
  ```
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Verify `contentful-management` package is available
- [ ] **Permissions**: Verify management token has sufficient permissions
- [ ] **Backup Environment**: Create backup environment in Contentful

### Content Validation

- [ ] **Content Types**: Verify blogPost, project, testimonial content types exist
- [ ] **Entry Count**: Document current entry counts for each content type
- [ ] **Field Mapping**: Review current field structure vs. planned enhancements

### Team Preparation

- [ ] **Team Notification**: Notify team of migration schedule
- [ ] **Maintenance Window**: Schedule maintenance window if needed
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Review rollback procedures with team

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Content Type Enhancement

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes  
**Script**: `migration-phase-1-comprehensive.cjs`

**What it does**:

- Adds 6 new fields to blogPost content type
- Adds 5 new fields to project content type
- Adds 6 new fields to testimonial content type
- Total: 17 new fields across all content types

**Pre-execution**:

```bash
# Verify script exists
ls -la scripts/migration-phase-1-comprehensive.cjs

# Test connection
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log(process.env.CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID)"
```

**Execution**:

```bash
cd scripts
node migration-phase-1-comprehensive.cjs
```

**Verification**:

- Check Contentful web interface for new fields
- Verify all fields are optional
- Confirm content types are published

### Phase 2: Data Population

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes  
**Script**: `migration-phase-2-data-population.cjs`

**What it does**:

- Populates blogPost fields (slugs, categories, tags, etc.)
- Populates project fields (URLs, featured flags, etc.)
- Populates testimonial fields (ratings, client info, etc.)

**Pre-execution**:

```bash
# Verify Phase 1 completed successfully
# Check that fields exist in Contentful
```

**Execution**:

```bash
cd scripts
node migration-phase-2-data-population.cjs
```

**Verification**:

- Check sample entries in Contentful
- Verify data quality and consistency
- Confirm all entries have been processed

### Phase 3: Field Requirements Update

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes  
**Script**: `migration-phase-3-field-requirements.cjs`

**What it does**:

- Makes `slug` required for blogPost
- Makes `repositoryUrl` required for project
- Makes `rating` required for testimonial

**Pre-execution**:

```bash
# Verify Phase 2 completed successfully
# Verify all entries have required field values
```

**Execution**:

```bash
cd scripts
node migration-phase-3-field-requirements.cjs
```

**Verification**:

- Check field requirements in Contentful
- Test entry creation with required fields
- Verify validation errors for missing fields

### Phase 4: Application Integration

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Documentation**: `migration-phase-4-application-integration.md`

**What it involves**:

- Update TypeScript interfaces ✅ (Already completed)
- Update data transformers ✅ (Already completed)
- Update frontend components
- Update URL routing
- Update search and filtering
- Update form validation
- Testing and quality assurance

**Manual checklist**: See `migration-phase-4-application-integration.md`

## Orchestrated Execution

### Using the Migration Orchestrator

The migration orchestrator provides a unified interface for executing all phases:

**List all phases**:

```bash
node migration-orchestrator.cjs list
```

**Execute complete migration**:

```bash
node migration-orchestrator.cjs full
```

**Execute with pauses for verification**:

```bash
node migration-orchestrator.cjs full --pause-between-phases
```

**Execute individual phase**:

```bash
node migration-orchestrator.cjs phase phase1
```

**Skip backup (not recommended)**:

```bash
node migration-orchestrator.cjs full --skip-backup
```

### Recommended Execution Approach

1. **Development Environment First**:

   ```bash
   # Set environment to development
   export CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=development

   # Run full migration
   node migration-orchestrator.cjs full --pause-between-phases
   ```

2. **Production Environment**:

   ```bash
   # Set environment to master
   export CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=master

   # Run with all safeguards
   node migration-orchestrator.cjs full --pause-between-phases
   ```

## Verification Procedures

### After Each Phase

**Phase 1 Verification**:

```bash
# Check content types in Contentful web interface
# Verify field counts match expectations
# Confirm all fields are optional initially
```

**Phase 2 Verification**:

```bash
# Sample entry checks
# Data quality validation
# Field population completeness
```

**Phase 3 Verification**:

```bash
# Test required field validation
# Verify entry creation fails without required fields
# Check content type field requirements
```

### Data Quality Checks

Create verification scripts to validate data:

```javascript
// Example verification
const entries = await environment.getEntries({ content_type: 'blogPost' });
const entriesWithoutSlug = entries.items.filter(e => !e.fields.slug);
console.log(`${entriesWithoutSlug.length} entries missing slug`);
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (if needed)

**Phase 1 Rollback**:

```bash
# Remove added fields
node rollback-phase-1.cjs
```

**Phase 2 Rollback**:

```bash
# Clear populated data
node rollback-phase-2.cjs
```

**Phase 3 Rollback**:

```bash
# Make fields optional again
node rollback-phase-3.cjs
```

**Complete Environment Restore**:

```bash
# Restore from backup environment
contentful space environment create --name "master-restored" --source backup-20250712
```

### Rollback Decision Tree

```
Issue Detected?
├── Data Quality Issues → Rollback Phase 2
├── Field Validation Issues → Rollback Phase 3
├── Content Type Issues → Rollback Phase 1
└── Complete Failure → Full Environment Restore
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Content API Response Times**
   - Baseline: Current response times
   - Alert: >5 seconds response time

2. **Application Error Rates**
   - Baseline: Current error rates
   - Alert: >5% error rate increase

3. **Content Entry Validation**
   - Monitor validation failures
   - Alert: >10% validation failures

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check API response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null "https://cdn.contentful.com/spaces/$SPACE_ID/entries"

# Check application health
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || echo "Application health check failed"

# Check entry validation
node scripts/validate-entries.cjs
```

## Timeline and Scheduling

### Recommended Schedule

**Week 1: Development Environment**

- Day 1: Execute Phases 1-3 in development
- Day 2-3: Verify data quality and application integration
